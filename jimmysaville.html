            <h2>Jimmy Saville</h2>
Sir Jimmy Saville (born James Wilson Vincent Saville in Leeds on October 30, 1926) is a British DJ and television personality. He is best known for his BBC television show Jim'll Fix It where he made the wishes of children come true.
<br<br>
A former coal miner, Saville started off his DJ career working for Radio Luxembourg, working there from 1958 to 1967. On January 1, 1964, he presented the first televised edition of Top of the Pops in Manchester. He presented the television program Jim'll Fix It from 1971 to 1991. In 1971 he received his OBE and in 1990 he received a knighthood, making him "Sir Jimmy Saville". He has carried out a significant amount of charity work, including raising money for the Stoke Mandeville Hospital.
<br>br>
His catchphrases include "how's about that, then", "now then, now then" and "guys and gals". He has frequently been spoofed for his distinctive appearance (track suit, lots of jewelry, cigar and masses of white hair).
