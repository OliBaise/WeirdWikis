            <h2>Padel</h2>
Padel tennis (or just Padel) is a racquet sport played extensively in Spain and Latin America. It is not the same as Paddle tennis
          <br><br>
Padel, is typically played in doubles on an enclosed court about half the size of a tennis court. The balls used and the scoring is the same as normal tennis, and so the biggest difference is that the court has walls and the balls can be played off them in a similar way as in the game of squash.<br><br>
<br><br>
The sport has been around for many years and although it is currently most popular in Spain and some Latin American countries it is now beginning to spread rapidly across Europe and and other continents. The sports huge popularity along the Costa del Sol in southern Spain has exposed it to a large number of British residents and holiday-makers and this is one of the reasons it is beginning to take-off in the UK.
          <br>br>
          Padel is great for players of all ages and skills, as it is both quick and easy to pick up, and is less physically demanding than similar sports like squash. Most players get the grasp of it within the first 20 minutes of playing and find it easy to achieve a level of proficiency so that they can enjoy it because the game is not as dominated by strength and serve as tennis (in fact the serve in padel is under-arm).
