        <main>Bali</h2>
          1. An Island of Indonesia

<br><br><br>

Bali, a popular tourist destination in Indonesia, lies off the east coast of Java.

          <br><br><br>

  2. Ile De Re

          <br<br><br>
An island off the west coast of France, connected to the mainland by a bridge about 4 KM long and which does not have any billboards. The island itself is about 21 KM long and about 5 KM at its widest. It has about the same number of hours of sunshine as the famous southern coast of France but always has at least a light breeze blowing and the water temperature is generally cooler. All around the island are gently sloping sandy beaches which is a real treat for families with kids.
          <br><br>
          The island has about 16,000 residents in winter and about 160,000 in summer but as they are distributed all over the island it never gets too crowded. The island is covered by bicycle tracks which contributes towards the fact that a large number of families hardly use the cars that the came over with. Camping grounds and hotels abound and with a few large supermarkets and all modern amenities, it leaves you wanting nothing. Most families don't get off the island untl the end of their vacations.
          <br><br>
          Night life consists of going to St. Martin, the capital city, or La Flotte to walk along the quays, potter around the shops that are open very late, watch the buskers have a drink and above all to enjoy the delicious artisanale ice cream and you can do it with all of the family. It has its fair share of celebrities including Lionel Jospin the Prime Minister of France who goes there regularly for his holidays.
          <br><br>
          Oysters, fresh fish and the tradition where the fishermen sell a small quantity of their catch directly on the quays when they get back, to buy a drink. Markets on a daily basis in the main towns where you go not just to buy but to look, taste, chat. Even the vendors in the markets come here on holiday because they work only the morning and then enjoy themselves the rest of the day. Comics, African articles, clothes, artefacts, food, tools evrything for all tastes.
          <br><br>
          I have been going there for more than five years with my family and enjoying the healthy, literally and figuratively, family atmosphere.
