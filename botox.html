            <h2>Botox</h2>
<b>Botulinum toxin</b> is the toxic compound produced by the bacterium [[Clostridium botulinum]]; by interfering with nerve impulses, it causes paralysis of muscles in Botulism. 
          <br><br>
          Botulinus toxin is used (usually under a trademarked name such as `Botox') for producing long term (months) paralysis of muscles. This was intended for the relief of uncontrollable muscle spasm, but is increasingly being abused for cosmetic purposes, to paralyse facial muscles as a means of concealing wrinkles.
          <br><br>
Botulinum toxin has long been considered an ideal agent for chemical warfare, (though, given it's origins, the distiction from biological warfare is a thin one), as it oxidises quite rapidly on exposure to air, so an area attacked with a toxin aerosol would be safe to enter within a day or so. There are no documented cases of the toxin actually being used in warfare. The toxin's properties did not escape the attention of the Aum Supreme Truth cult in Japan, who actually set up a plant for bulk production of this agent, though their terrorist and assassination attacks used the nerve agent Sarin instead, as being easier to disperse and faster acting.
