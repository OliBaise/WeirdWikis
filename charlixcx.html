            <h2>Charli XCX</h2>
            <b>Charlotte Aitchinson</b>, known by her stage name <b>Charli XCX</b> is a UK-based singer-songwriter. She released two EPs in 2008 titled "Emelline/Art Bitch" and "!Francesckaar!" She was signed to This Is Music, before releasing two singles "Stay Away" and "Nuclear Seasons"
<H2>Early Life</H2>
Born and raised in Hertfordshire, she started her own band on the playground when she was around 7. She used to bully her friends into imitating the Spice Girls with her. When she got older, she realised her career was going nowhere and phoned up the cheapest recording studio to record her first music.
<H2>Career</H2>
          Hitchinson was signed to Orgy Music where she released an unknown debut album and her first two EPs "Emelline/Art Bitch" and "!Franchesckaar!" in late 2008. In 2011, she featured in Alex Metric's single "End of the World" before premiering her first two songs "Stay Away" and "Nuclear Seasons". She released the latter as a free download on her website, and has released two more free singles titled "Valentine" and "I'll Never Know" since. An album is expected for a 2012 release featuring the two first singles.
