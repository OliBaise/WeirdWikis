            <h2>Chad</h2>
           A Chad is a generally derogatory slang term referring to a young urban white man, typically single and in his 20's or early 30's. The term originated during the 1990's in Chicago, Illinois. The term was further popularlized by a satirical Website dedicated to the Lincoln Park Chad Society, a fictional social club based in Chicago's upscale Lincoln Park neighborhood The equally stereotyped female counterparts of Chads are generically given the name "Trixie.
<br><br>
Chads are typically depicted as originating from Chicago's affluent North Shore suburbs (Highland Park, Lincolnshire, Deerfield, Northbrook, Glenco, Winnetka, Glenview, Wilmette, Evanston or Lake Forest)", attending private prep school, receiving a BMW for his 16th birthday, obtaining a law degree from a Big 10 University, moving to Lincoln Park, marrying a Trixie, and then moving back to the North Suburbs."
<br><br>
As such, "Chads" are not unique to Chicago but representative of a stereotyped subculture in contemporary America.
