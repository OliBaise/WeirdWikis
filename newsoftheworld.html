            <h2>News of the World</h2>
            The <br>News of the World</b> is a British tabloid newspaper published every Sunday. It is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News International newspaper group. The newspaper tends to concentrate on 'lighter' news, its fondness for sex scandals has gained it the nickname "News of the Screws". In December 2002 it sold 3.78 million copies. The current editor is Andy Cooulson, who replaced Rebekah Wade in January 2003.

          The newspaper was first published on October 1, 1843 in London by John Browne Bell. Priced at just three pence, even before the repeal of the Stamp Act (1855) or paper duty (1861), it was the cheapest newspaper of its time and was aimed directly at the newly literate working classes. It quickly established itself as a purveyor of titilation, shock and criminal news. Despite being dismissed as a "scandal sheet" it soon established itself as the most widely read Sunday paper. Initial sales were around 12,000 copies a week. The success encouraged other similar newspapers of which the People, the Daily Mail, the Daily Express and the Daily Mirror are still being published.

          It had the slogan "All human life is there"

          The newspaper passed into the hands of Murdoch's News Ltd. in 1969, snatching the paper from Robert Maxwell's Pergamon Press after a year long struggle, it was his first 'Fleet Street' acquisition. Maxwell had been supported by the Jackson family (25% shareholders) but Murdoch had gained the support of the Carr family (30%) and then-chairman William Carr.

          The newspaper has often had to defend itself from libel charges, the results of certain news gathering techniques and its contentious campaigns.
