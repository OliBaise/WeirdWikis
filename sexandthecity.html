        <main>Sex and The City</h2>
Popular tv show that portrays the lives of 4 New York City best friends reaching their 40's and looking for love, often in the wrong places.
          <br><br>
The show stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Catrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.
          <br><br>
          Set in uptown New York it puts 'Carrie', (Parker), a business-woman like writer, together with 'Charlotte', (Davis), a naive, shy and conservative woman who suddenly discovers her wild side after a divorce, 'Miranda',(Nixon), a girl who has discovered motherhood after living a virtually responsibility-free lifestyle, and 'Samantha'(Catrall), a wild living, fun loving woman who stops at nothing to get the men she wants, yet has a heart of gold.
          <br><br>
          Parker and Catralla have also had very successful movie careers.
          <br><br>
          Started in 1997, the show then depicted 4 women in their middle 30's. But as time has progressed, so have the characters and situations. Clearly a soap opera style comedy, the show has had great success every season, and likely will become a tv classic in the future.
          <br><br>
the series, based on a book, is produced by HBO.
