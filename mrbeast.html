            <h2>Mr Beast</h2>
Jimmy Donaldson (born May 7, 1998), known online as MrBeast, is an American YouTuber and philanthropist.
          <h2>Internet Career</h2>
          In January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000 which notched more than five million views in five days. However, it was critically observed that, among other things, Donaldson missed a couple of numbers (81,933 and 99,913) and counted "24,219" thrice. A subsequent video titled "Counting To 200,000 (Road To A Mil)" was uploaded the next month, although, according to Donaldson, it had to be sped up because the full fifty-five hours of counting exceeded YouTube's upload limit.
          <br><br>
          Donaldson has been described as "YouTube’s biggest philanthropist", and often vlogs about his extreme acts of charity that include paying off his own mother's mortgage, giving three million pennies ($30,000) to his 3 millionth subscriber, and tipping a pizza deliveryman $10,000.[5] In another instance, Donaldson reportedly tipped a waitress $10,000 for serving him two glasses of water.

          Having started his YouTube career by making video game tutorials, Donaldson also runs a second account, "Mr.Beast", that is exclusively dedicated to his Fortnite gameplay.
          <H2>Media Reception</H2>
          In May 2018, Donaldson was criticised by Taylor Lorenz of The Atlantic for his supposedly homophobic tweets that contained slurs like "fag" and "gay". He responded by stating that "I’m not offensive in the slightest bit in anything I do."
