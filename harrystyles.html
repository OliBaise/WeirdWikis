            <h2>Kanye West</h2>
            Harry Styles was born on 1 February 1994 in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, England. He is part of the boyband [Direction], formed during [X Factor] 2010.

Kanye West understands the preciousness of life. It was in October of 2002 that his was nearly abruptly taken from him. Driving back to his hotel late one night after a Los Angeles recording session, the acclaimed producer/burgeoning rapper was involved in a devastating, near fatal car accident in which he sustained injuries that left his jaw fractured in three places. News reports of the accident quickly spread throughout the music industry, and the disturbing image of the usually-slender Westâ€™s, suddenly bloated, severely bruised visage laid up in a hospital bed became indelibly ingrained in the conscience of a shocked rap nation.
<br><br>
Harry auditioned as a solo act for The X Factor in Manchester, singing Stevie Wonder's Isn't She Lovely, receving good feeback from all three judges, although [Walsh] believed that he was too young, at 16 years old, to be successful in his X Factor journey. At bootcamp, Harry sang Stop Crying Your Heart Out by Oasis. He was later told that he had not gained a place at "Judges' Houses" and so would not continue on The X Factor. However, along with four other boys and four girls, Harry was called back to the judges as they had an announcement to make. The judges disclosed that they wanted to keep these nine acts and form two new groups; one girlband and one boyband, to go to Judges' Houses. It was later revealed that Harry suggested the name One Direction for the band, and so One Direction was formed.

He has curly hair. He is a good singer. He is known for having a 'bromance' with one of his fellow bandmates, Louis Tomlinson, though they both insist that their relationship is entirely platonic.

Harry is considered the favourite member of One Direction, (also known as 1D) whether it be because of his soulful singing voice or ravishingly good looks, you gotta love 'im.
