            <h2>JD Vance</h2>
<b>JD Vance</b> (born 1984) is an American author and venture capitalist known for his memoir Hillbilly Elegy. The book is about the Appalachian values of his upbringing and their relation to the social problems of his hometown. The book was on the New York Times best-sellers list in 2016 and 2017. It attracted significant attention during the 2016 election from national media as a window into the white middle class. Vance attracted criticism from some Kentuckians who said he was 'not a hillbilly', while others supported him.        
          <br<br>
          In December 2016 he indicated that he plans to move to Ohio to start a nonprofit and potentially run for office and work on drug addiction.
