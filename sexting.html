            <h2>Sexting</h2>
   "Sexting" is the act of performing sexual acts with another person while using text messages.
<br><br>
It is considered by many to be the "lowest" form of sexual relations, just a step under internet cyber sex. This is becuase it is performed with abbreviations such as "u", "y", "r", ect.
<H2>History</H2>
          The term "Sexting" was origonally coined by Eric Ketteman, also known as "Skip" while driving in his car, refering to how lovers keep intimate over long distance.
          <h2>Uses</h2>
          There has yet to be an act of "Sexting" that I know about, but I'm sure it has happened. Edit if you know of any.
