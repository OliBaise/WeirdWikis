            <h2>List of Internet Phenomena</h2>
An Internet phenomenon is akin to a fad, in which something relatively unknown becomes increasingly popular, but usually for a short duration of time. It is nearly impossible to accurately measure the depth of a phenomenon's popularity, and different groups of the Internet may participate more than others. The internet has a much greater lack of real world physical boundaries, lending itself to a faster spreading of information and ideas, especially when the subject is based around humor or curiosity.
