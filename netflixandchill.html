            <h2>Netflix and Chill</h2>
          Netflix and chill is a euphemistic phrase, typically used by teenagers, that is slang for "hook up and have premarital sex." It was first used in 2009, but became so popular in 2015 that Fusion described it as "inescapable" among teenage internet users.
          <h2>Hstory</h2>
          The first recorded use of the phrase "Netflix and chill" was in a tweet posted in 2009. Originally, the phrase's meaning was not sexual but simply referred to watching the streaming service Netflix by oneself. The euphemistic nature of the phrase began to be established in 2014, when numerous girls who had been asked to "Netflix and chill" by boys, and had thought that this referred only to watching Netflix, discovered the boys' true motiveâ€”sex. In April 2015, a definition of the phrase was added to Urban Dictionary that said that it meant "code for two people going to each others houses and fucking or doing other sexual related acts."
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    In October 2015, someone began selling condoms bearing the phrase "Netflix and chill". In November 2015, someone spray-painted the words "and chill" below the Netflix logo outside the company's headquarters in Los Gatos, California.
