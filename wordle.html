            <h2>Wordle</h2>
         Wordle is an online word game developed by Josh Wardle, a Reddit engineer who had previously created the social experiment r/place. Every day, a five-letter word is chosen that players aim to guess within six tries.[2] After each guess, the letters are either marked as green, yellow, or gray; green means that the letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means that the letter is in the answer but not in the right position, and gray means the letter is not in the answer at all. The game became a viral phenomenon on Twitter in late December 2021, after Wardle added a "share" element to the game, allowing users to copy their results in the form of a grid of square emoji. Several media outlets, including CNET and The Indian Express, attributed the game's popularity to the dailiness of the puzzles.
